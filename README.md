# Breaking Brick
Brick breaking game with level creator made using javascript, html, css and threejs. 
All the levels are the same and require the player to create them themselves. I could've hard coded some default levels in directly in the javascript but I didn't think of that at the time. 

There was a rewrite of this game because I was very unsatisfied with the code quality but that version was never fully finished.
